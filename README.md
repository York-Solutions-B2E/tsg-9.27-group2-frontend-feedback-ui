TSG 9.27 Group2

TSG 9.27 Group2 is a full-stack feedback collection system. The application allows users to submit feedback through a React frontend, which is sent to Kafka for processing and ultimately stored in a PostgreSQL database.
***

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of three separate repositories that work together:

### Frontend (React) – A user-facing interface for submitting feedback.
```
https://github.com/York-Solutions-B2E/tsg-9.27-group2-frontend-feedback-ui.git
```

### Feedback API (Spring Boot) – Receives feedback from the frontend and sends messages to Kafka.

```
https://github.com/SneakThief23/tsg-9.27-Group2-feedback-api.git
```

### Feedback Analytics Consumer (Spring Boot) – Consumes Kafka messages and stores them in PostgreSQL.

```

## Tech Stack
|Layer | Technologies          |
|-|-|
|Frontend| React                 |
|Backend| Spring Boot           |
|Message Broker| Kafka (running KRaft) |
|Database| PostgreSQL            |
|Containerization| Docker                |
***

## Local Setup

Clone the three repositories inside a single parent folder:

```
parent-folder/ <br>
├── feedback-ui                (React frontend) <br>
├── feedback-api               (Spring Boot producer) <br>
├── feedback-analytics-consumer (Spring Boot consumer)
```
***

## How to run the project

Make sure all three repositories are inside the same parent folder.

Navigate into the frontend folder and open in IntelliJ.

### Run: 
```
cd tsg-9.27-group2-frontend-feedback-ui
docker compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build and start the React frontend <br>
- Start Kafka
- Start the Feedback API service <br>
- Start the Feedback Analytics Consumer service <br>
- Start PostgreSQL

All services will come up using a shared Docker network defined in the frontend compose file.

# Feedback Flow

>1. User submits feedback from the React UI.</li>
>2. Feedback API receives the request and publishes a message to Kafka.
>3. Feedback Analytics Consumer reads the Kafka message.
>4. Consumer writes the feedback record into PostgreSQL.

# API Endpoints

Swagger UI
Producer: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
Consumer: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html

Base Path `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`

- `GET /api/v1/feedback` - Returns all feedback for a given Member Id.
- `GET /api/v1/feedback/{id}` - Returns feedback for a specific UUID.
- `POST /api/v1/feedback` - Submit new feedback.
